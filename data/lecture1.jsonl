So I will talk about the system structure of a computer and as you can see here, a computer system is consisted of four components, the hardware, which is basically the, the, the the entities that provide basic computing resources like the CPU the memory, the L devices. And we have the operating system which is the one of the focus of this course. And it's the thing that controls and the coordinates all the hardware. Uh it's a kind of interface between the applications and the hardware. And then you have the application of programs we call sometimes and it is basically the uh the things that the user use to achieve a certain function in the computer.

Some of them you don't directly use it like the compiler assembler, but their application, their background applications running on your operating system. Now, um you know the interface between this application programs and the hardware is the operating system like I said it coordinates all the programs, application programs and the hardware. And now at the bottom layer, we have a hardware which is the entities that are actually doing the things.

So these are some additional reading to give you a sense of what is the operating system? Now, coming back to the quick question I asked before about, you know, different kind of devices and whether or not they have over operating systems. So the answer is that it really depends. So if you are talking about Tesla car, then certainly it has a car operating system because you have all the software and hardware that needs to be managed. But if you are talking about a old um you know, watch that has no electronic component, then it doesn't have an operating system. And for your hardware, I mean, for your microwave, it does have hardware, but it doesn't necessarily have an operating system because the computation and hardware might be so simple. So you don't need an operating system to control or operate anything. So in that case, uh it doesn't have an operating system. But if we are talking about very advanced or newer microwave that might communicate with all the other devices in your room, uh which can talk to Alexa or other computing system.

{"lecture_id": "lecture1", "segment_text": "Now, what does an operating system do? So from the user's point of view in OS is basically trying to provide the ease of use and a good performance for the user, that's what the users care about. The user just wanted to make sure that they can run the computer fast and they can solve their task at hand through the computer. They don't really care about the resources that are used or how are the resources are used between the hardware and the software. So that, that's from the user's point of view. However, from the um system point of view, from the system point of view, the operating system is actually a allocator for resource. The OS needs to manage all kinds of resources like the CPU the memory, the storage, they want to decide, you know which program should use, what kind of resources at a specific time and how do we manage those complicating requests from different application program? And also uh from the system point of view, OS is a control program. So it it execute the control between a particular program and some hardware. So for example, the um a program wants to utilize the screen or the keyboard, then the OS will have to send a signal to the particular screen or the keyboard so that these devices know that um there is something going to to to to show. So that's basically what I mean by control control is different from resource allocator.

And I know that this is a controversial definition because it, it's ambiguous um because when different vendors ships a computer, what it comes with is different. So, um for example, when we order a Microsoft computer, then it typically includes application program like Microsoft Word or the uh internet browser, the IE browser.

{"lecture_id": "lecture1", "segment_text": "Um But one thing that is important to know or um to differentiate from those application program is something called kernel.

So we said that there is a controversial definition and understanding of what an operating system is, but the kernel is kind of the core of the operating system. And we don't have any um you know, uh you know, sort of a controversial opinion or argument over what is a kernel and that's a program that always run and it's basically the mini version of the operating system.

So that means it's um instruction is basically um the each of the individual things that we have to do within the program. So executing the instruction basically means doing the computation.

That way we can utilize this memory that is closer to AC PU instead of going to the main memory directory. So as you can see here, cache is closer to the CPU.

When you try to access something uh on the cash, when you find that thing, you have a cash hit. But if you do not find the thing you want, for example, a data or a instruction, then you say it's a cash miss. So in that case, when you have a cash miss, then what you have to do is you have to go to the memory and find out the thing that you want to reach. And the CPU basically have to transfer that data or the instruction from the memory into the cache. And the later time when you are trying to access the same thing, you can basically directly go to the cache instead of going to the memory again. So cash is something that helps you in the long run.

And the typical cash ratio is actually 95% or higher. So that basically tells us that, you know, if you have a very good cash, if you have a very fast cash, your CPU performance will be very high because the CPU can utilize the cash most of the time.

It is basically saying that most of the things that has to be addressed continuously are typically held in the similar location on your memory, on your cache. So here is the example and also an illustration here. So when you try to access a word and address K, it's very likely that next time the PC, the CPU trying to access something is the data right next to it or part of the large data piece right next to the data at address K. So for example, I'm trying to access a large things that contains multiple small part. I'm first going to access the thing at address K, then I'm going to likely to address K plus four or K plus eight something like that.

And then on the right part of the screen is the assembly language that is understood by the computer hardware. This is not something we will be writing, but this is something translated from the language we write. And this is something that is read by the computer by the hardware. Uh In this case, it will be something read by the CPU. So it's basically saying that um uh from the assembly language point of view, from hardware point of view, um you know, they have to repeatedly access this portion of the code because this thing has to be a loop for a certain number of times. And when you first try to access this part of the code, this is part of the address in your memory, you have to load them from the memory to the cache.

And using the cache can provide the speed up for the main memory access. There are two types of main memory. They are all random access memory because you can address any byte as you wish. So they called random access memory. RA M uh One type is dynamic RM which basically needs to be uh constantly refresh as the values that are stored decay over time. So they have to be retur and we also have the static R which retains the data in its memory as long as the power is being supplied.

And uh the way that IO devices work is interesting in the way we want, I want to talk about it a little bit is uh first of all, the IO devices can be pulled. So you know, when you, you, the CPU can try to talk to the IO devices periodically and to see if the IO device needs some attention. And that's the case with the keyboard. So how the keyboard is working um is that um the CPU will try to see whether the keyboard needs some attention. In other words, whether or not there is any new data to put into the memory or put into the hard disk through the keyboard. So what happens is that the CPA will try to access the, try to talk to the keyboard periodically in a very fast uh you know, frequency typically like 15 nanoseconds and then the keyboard will tell the CPU whether or not there's something new and if not, then CPU will just go back and then come back in the next period. Otherwise, it will just access the data and then put the data to the memory or somewhere else. So that's called the pulling based interaction. And there's another way of interaction is called interrupt based. Um um you know, interrupt based interaction and this kind of interrupt based interaction, the you know, the interaction is driven by the IO devices. So when IO devices needs attention, it will use an interrupt to tell the CPU that something needs to be done. And in that case, the CPU will suspend its current processing and it will use a special routine to perform the specific service to that interrupt. Let's say I have a mouse click and I interrupt the CPU. Then the CPU will perform a routine to serve my mouse click to basically tell the operating system that oh, something is clicked.

If the CPU is also accessing the memory, there will be a conflict because everything has to go through the bus. So there are two specific factors to consider. Um that allows some kind of a parallel memory access by the CPU and the device that perform in the D DNA. So one situation is that the CPU is taking multiple cycles to execute an instruction. And uh um it can often execute the entire instruction without further memory access in the last few of the cycles. So it can use one or two cycles to access the memory and the last few cycles of the instruction, it doesn't need a memory access. So in that case, we can have a sort of a parallel access of the memory by the device using D MA and the CPU. So in other words, what I meant here is that uh for, for the CPU is is executing an instruction and that takes a lot of cycles, the first one or two cycles I already finished. The communication with the memory. And then in the rest of the cycles, the device that using the D MA may uh use those time. Even though the CPU is still working on that instruction, the device performing the D MA can utilize the memory directly. So that's one case and the second case is here. Um So the device performing the D MA is significantly lower than the CPU. So the CPU do not have to halt on every instruction. So the CPU can just occasionally, you know, halt when the D MA device is accessing the memory in that sense.

Now, um when the OAS has to be used, it has to be initialized. Now, that question involves how a system is boosted. So when the power is initialized on a computer system execution, execution will start at a fixed memory location. And that's typically the firmware. So that firmware will hold the initial boot code. And the OS basically um will be loaded after that initial boot happens. So what happens is that typically two ways, there are two ways in the first ways that we have a small piece of a code called bootstrap loader. Uh It's typically in the Bios. So um it's, it's, it's, it's a bios. So bios is one of the examples of the bootstrap loader and it's typically stored in the room and the room is the um is the memory. Um It's the storage place that do not change over time like the memory, it's a fixed storage, static storage space. So this uh bootstrap loader or Bios is stored in the room.

Uh The kernel is the core of your OS and it includes all the essential functions to run and keep a computer running. Now, the second step, uh second way of loading uh kernel is a two step process.

So there is this concept called multi programming that organize multiple jobs or application program. So the CPU can um basically walk them, work with them together. But because the CPU can only has one job to execute at one time, so there has to be some sort of a coordinating scheduling between these different jobs by the CPU. So this is the job scheduling. CPU will pick one job to do at one time. And all these pending jobs will be kept in the memory and when they are needed, the CPU will schedule them and then execute them. So that is the concept of a multi programming. And of course CPU sometimes has to wait to be served.

The user will not feel that the job is executed one by one, but they will have the feeling that everything is executed together. And that is what we are doing with the modern computers.

So that's why we have to manage the allocation of resources to all these processes.

Um But that is one of the unique features for the operating system for this type of computing environment. Next, we have a virtualized computer environment and that's um basically uh interesting technology that allows the um OS to be compiled natively for the CPU by running some guest OS S that also natively compiled. So you can have multiple OS S running on a single hardware computer.

{"lecture_id": "lecture1", "segment_text": "And that is a similar term or technique called emulation. Um But we have to differentiate it from the virtualization and the emulation is used when a source CPU type is different from the target type. For example, if we want to virtualize a smartphone on a desktop computer, those two different computing environment, they have different CPU types. One is for mobile, one is for desktop. In that case, it is not a SSS simple, straightforward uh virtualization is actually an emulation because the desktop computers has to emulate the way that the mobile CPU is working.

But in the virtualized environment uh through the virtual machine manager, on top of the same piece of hardware, you can have different type of uh machine basically software machine. They are using different kernel, different processes and that's a virtualization. And because of virtualized environment, cloud computing becomes very popular because we can centralize the hardware of all the computing resources at one specific location and then virtualize them using a hard using a software.
